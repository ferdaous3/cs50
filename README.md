# CS50 Assignments

Hi! ðŸ‘‹  
This is where Iâ€™m saving my CS50 problem sets.  
Iâ€™m learning C and computer science basics, and this repo is kinda like my notebook as I go through the course.  

## Whatâ€™s inside?
So far I have:
- hello.c â†’ my first C program saying hello
- mario_less.c â†’ a simple pyramid
- mario_more.c â†’ double pyramid
- cash.c â†’ program to calculate coins
- credit.c â†’ program to validate credit cards

More files coming as I move forward ðŸš€

## Notes
These are my own solutions while learning.  
Feel free to look, but please donâ€™t just copy â€” try to solve the problems yourself first!
